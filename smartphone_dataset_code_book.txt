Notes: 
======
The name of each variable for which the mean was calculated in the resulting data set was derived by
concatenating the word "mean" to the name of the variable from the file features.txt.
 
The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g' and is
therefore the unit of measure for all variables with the sub string "Acc" in its name.
 
The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second 
and is therefore the unit of measure for all variables with the sub string "Gyro" in its name. 

Variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
